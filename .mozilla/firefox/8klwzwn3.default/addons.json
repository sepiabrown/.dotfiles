It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230365.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230365.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230368.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230368.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230367.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230367.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny modes"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230369.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230369.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230370.png?modified=1578152402","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230370.png?modified=1578152402","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The unified logger tells you all that uBO is seeing and doing"}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","supportURL":"https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6985,"reviewCount":4065,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":239435,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3521827/ublock_origin-1.25.2-an+fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1585231809000},{"id":"{b9db16a4-6edc-47ec-a1f4-b86292ed211d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/3/3006-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/3/3006-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/3/3006-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"type":"extension","name":"Video DownloadHelper","version":"7.3.9","creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/user/32479/"},"developers":[],"description":"The easy way to download and convert Web videos from hundreds of YouTube-like sites.","fullDescription":"Video DownloadHelper is the most complete tool for extracting videos and image files from websites and saving them to your hard drive.\n\nJust surf the web as you normally do. When DownloadHelper detects embedded videos it can access for download, the toolbar icon highlights and a simple menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item.\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with most other popular video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe, and thousands of others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, HLS, DASH, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is able to capture the media directly from the screen and generate a video file.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also capable of making file conversions (i.e. change audio and video formats) and aggregation (combining separate audio and video into a single file). This is an upgrade feature that helps pay for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from websites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nVideo overview on how to use Video DownloadHelper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZT8yI60k_4\n\nSupport can be obtained from the dedicated support forum.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), or Facebook.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?modified=1543518772","width":200,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?modified=1543518772","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?modified=1543518772","width":327,"height":124,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.png?modified=1543518772","thumbnailWidth":327,"thumbnailHeight":124,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?modified=1543518773","width":250,"height":200,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.png?modified=1543518773","thumbnailWidth":250,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?modified=1543518774","width":361,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.png?modified=1543518774","thumbnailWidth":361,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?modified=1543518774","width":320,"height":317,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.png?modified=1543518774","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?modified=1543518775","width":293,"height":250,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.png?modified=1543518775","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":250,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"homepageURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/","supportURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2758,"reviewCount":16674,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":165701,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3534334/video_downloadhelper-7.3.9-an+fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1585837841000},{"id":"enhancerforyoutube@maximerf.addons.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/700/700308-32.png?modified=4bc8e79f","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/700/700308-64.png?modified=4bc8e79f","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/700/700308-128.png?modified=4bc8e79f"},"type":"extension","name":"Enhancer for YouTube™","version":"2.0.101","creator":{"name":"Maxime RF","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/user/6294433/"},"developers":[],"description":"Tons of features to improve your user experience on YouTube™.","fullDescription":"Highly customizable and easy-to-use extension that allows you to:\n\n✔ Control volume level and playback speed with the mouse wheel\n\n✔ Remove ads from videos (automatically or on-demand)\n\n✔ Whitelist channels to not automatically remove their ads\n\n✔ Remove annotations (automatically or on-demand)\n\n✔ Automatically play videos in 4K, HD, or any other preferred format\n\n✔ Loop videos (in part or in whole)\n\n✔ Use custom themes\n\n✔ Use a larger video player\n\n✔ Pin the video player\n\n✔ Execute your own actions using JavaScript\n\n✔ And more...\n\nEnhancer for YouTube™ respects your privacy: https://www.mrfdev.com/privacy\n\nYouTube is a trademark of Google Inc.

Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"homepageURL":"http://www.one-tab.com","supportURL":"http://www.one-tab.com","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1672,"reviewCount":955,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":5605,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3359470/onetab-1.29-an+fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1564148560000},{"id":"ciscowebexstart1@cisco.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/735/735601-32.png?modified=5dd6f113","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/735/735601-64.png?modified=5dd6f113","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/735/735601-128.png?modified=5dd6f113"},"type":"extension","name":"Cisco Webex Extension","version":"1.5.0","creator":{"name":"Cisco WebEx","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/user/12550805/"},"developers":[],"description":"Join Webex meetings using Firefox ™","fullDescription":"Cisco Webex web and video conferencing is an easy, cost-effective way to exchange ideas and information online with anyone, anywhere on any mobile device or video system.

YouTube™ occasionally updates its styling which may break DF Tube.

The only permissions I ask for are \"tabs\" to insert the functionality and \"storage\" to store your settings. I am a strong believer in privacy. This extension is just a tool to help remove the distracting elements from YouTube™.\n\nThe permissions used by this extensions are 1) Storage - to store your preferences, 2) Tabs - to load the DF YouTube script on each YouTube™ tab you open, 3) Notifications - probably for compatibility with the Chrome version, and 4) https://api.mailgun.net/* domain - which is a service I use to send your feedback to my email.\n\n***\n\nYouTube is directly incentivized to create as many views and ad clicks as possible. As a result we are inundated with tasty thumbnails and advertisements from every angle. While this is good for someone looking to kill time, it's not so good for those of us intending to focus on educational content, do research, or simply find some relaxing music to groove to.\n\nAfter using DF YouTube for a few days, you realize the extent to which the pattern of click, watch, scan mindlessly for a new video, click, watch, and repeat, has been ingrained in us by YouTube's design. DF YouTube breaks that cycle.\n\nBy default, DF YouTube hides the video recommendations sidebar as well as the related videos that appear at the end of videos. It also removes the grid of recommended videos that appear on your homepage. These settings are all configurable. It can also hide comments and disable playlists sitewide.\n\nI hope DF YouTube allows you to focus on the content *you* want to focus on.

Supports adding words to Skritter.\n\nThe most popular Chinese popup dictionary for Chrome. 60,000 active users worldwide. Quick, easy and simple to use. Includes useful tools for learners of Mandarin Chinese.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Look up more than 100,000 words an expressions while reading Chinese web sites just by pointing at the words with your mouse.\n- Includes links to grammar and usage notes for almost 400 keywords\n- Skritter users can add new words to their study list with a simple keystroke.\n- Save words to a built-in word list\n- Create Anki flashcards by importing the text file exported from the built-in word list\n- Easily look up example sentences on tatoeba.org\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nAfter installing the extension it can be turned on and off by clicking on the little icon in the upper right-hand corner of the browser. When it is activated, the word \"ON\" is displayed in red over the icon of the extension. Otherwise the extension is inactive.\n\nAfter activating it, simply go to a web page in Chinese and hover over the Chinese characters with your mouse to see a pop-up window open up showing the English translation along with the Pinyin romanization using the following colors: red = 1st tone, orange = 2nd tone, green = 3rd tone, blue = 4th tone. If simplified and traditional differ, then the simplified character is shown first.\n\nIf you're typing Chinese text, like an email, for example, simply hovering over the characters might not work. In that case, simply hold down the Alt-key on your keyboard while hovering over the Chinese characters you just typed. In most cases, this will bring up the translation. This way you can proofread what you just typed.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Supports both traditional and simplified characters.\n- Includes the current version of the widely used CC-CEDICT Chinese English dictionary with more than 100,000 entries.\n- Displays Hanyu Pinyin along both the simplified and traditional characters.\n- Learners of Chinese can choose a large font size for the Chinese characters to help them clearly identify and memorize the different characters, especially those with a large number of strokes. On the options page of the extension you can choose between a large and a small font size.\n- As a learning aid it uses different colors for displaying the Pinyin syllables, depending on the tone of the Chinese character. The color scheme is the same as the one used by Skritter. Tone coloring can be deactivated on the options page.\n- Can be turned on and off with a single mouse-click.\n- Highlights the characters whose translation is displayed in the popup window.\n- Also supports keyboard navigation for translating the next character, the next word, or the previous character.\n- Bopomofo (Zhuyin) can be activated on the extension's options page.\n\nEXTRAS\n\n- Built-in Skritter support: Directly add words to a Skritter vocab list for studying. Just hit \"s\" on the keyboard.\n\n- Built-in word list that you can add your words to. Just type \"r\" to remember a word when the popup is shown, \"Alt+W\" to open the word list. Words can be exported from the word list to a file.\n\n- Look up example sentences on tatoeba.org by simply typing \"t\" while the popup window is shown.\n\n- Provides keyboard shortcuts 'Alt+1', 'Alt+2', 'Alt+3', 'Alt+4', 'Alt+5' and 'Alt+6' for looking up selected text in other online dictionaries (nciku, YellowBridge, Dict.cn, iCIBA, MDBG and JuKuu).\n\n- In order to save a word to the internal word list, press \"r\" (for \"remember\") on your keyboard. To display the word list, use Alt+w, or \"Open word list\" from the context menu (right-click on the page). On the word list page, you can select the words you want to export to a file. You can then import them into other learning tools, like Anki.\n\nKEYBOARD NAVIGATION\n\nFor power users: When reading an entire paragraph, you can easily navigate to the next word by hitting 'n' on the keyboard. The 'b' key takes you back to the previous character. You can also navigate to the next character (not the next word) by using the 'm' key.\n\nIn addition, you can move the popup window around using the 'x' and the 'y' key, or move it to one of three alternate locations using the 'a' key.\n\nCOPY TO CLIPBOARD\n\nYou can copy the dictionary entry of the currently selected characters to the clipboard by using the 'c' key on your keyboard. This is useful if you want to paste this data into a spreadsheet, for example. Each entry appears on a separate line, and the individual parts a dictionary entry consists of are tab separated, so they appear nicely aligned in separate rows and columns when pasting them into a spreadsheet.\n\nNote that using this copying method (using just 'c') differs from the standard copy-to-clipboard shortcut (Ctrl+C or Command+C) which would copy only the selected Chinese characters without the English translation.\n\nINPUT FIELDS AND TEXT AREAS\n\nZhongwen also works in input fields and text areas. Simply hold down the Alt-key on your keyboard to see the dictionary entires, for example when composing an email.","screenshots":[],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/leezu/zhongwen","supportURL":"https://github.com/leezu/zhongwen/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7742,"reviewCount":19,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/addon/zhongwen-chinese-english/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":180,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1671251/zhongwen_chinese_english_popup_dictionary-4.21-fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1549203610000},{"id":"download-filename-encoding@qw.linux-2g64.local","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/851/851547-32.png?modified=1544114135","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/851/851547-64.png?modified=1544114135","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/851/851547-128.png?modified=1544114135"},"type":"extension","name":"Download Filename Encoding","version":"2.0","creator":{"name":"jingyu9575","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/user/6116843/"},"developers":[],"description":"Set the character encoding of download filenames.","fullDescription":"Update: Version 2.0 adds an icon for quick switching.

Set the default encoding in the \"Encoding\" text box, which is often the standard encoding of your country/language (e.g. \"GBK\" for Chinese).

All have the proposal to identify and/ or prevent the execution of questionable codes and requests.\n\nThese tools are vital, but we inevitably need to make concessions to access many websites as we have a massive use of JavaScript on the web. When you access for example the Google Translate website, with a combo of 3 extensions (HTTPS Everywhere, uBlock Origin and ScriptSafe) and Luminous, we have the following result after a few moments:\n\n- 6 requests influenced by HTTPS Everywhere\n- 75 requests blocked by uBlock Origin\n- 4 items blocked by ScriptSafe\n- 7,6 thousand JavaScript executions detected by Luminous\n\nIt’s about this number (7,6 thousand) that we are lost and with hands tied, it’s there that we do not know what happens and we still do not have the freedom to decide what can or can’t be executed. This is the main purpose of the project, filling this gap and being able to see and control what happens. As a side effect we end up also having an interesting tool that helps in JavaScript code developing process by giving us visibility about what is happening.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/198/198368.png?modified=1543521040","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198368.png?modified=1543521040","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/198/198369.png?modified=1543521042","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198369.png?modified=1543521042","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/198/198370.png?modified=1543521045","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198370.png?modified=1543521045","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/198/198371.png?modified=1543521048","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198371.png?modified=1543521048","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/198/198372.png?modified=1543521049","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198372.png?modified=1543521049","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/198/198373.png?modified=1543521051","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198373.png?modified=1543521051","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"homepageURL":"https://gbaptista.github.io/luminous/doc/en-US/","supportURL":"https://gbaptista.github.io/luminous/doc/en-US/","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.15,"reviewCount":14,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/addon/luminous/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":41,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3403905/luminous_javascript_events_blocker-0.0.28-fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1568479210000},{"id":"{2fcaaf30-4ccc-4939-93ed-fc87b1c615f7}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-32.png","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-64.png","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-128.png"},"type":"extension","name":"Naver
